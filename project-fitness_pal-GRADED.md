### Presentation (15/15)

The presentation was well-organized and covered the the important points of 
the project. It make very good use of visuals, and included an effective 
product demonstration. It highlighted the purpose of the product, the design, 
the technologies used, an in-depth look at the development methodology and 
processes, and provided an effective demo of the product. It also made good 
use of team members making different parts of the presentation.


### Repository (14/15)

The history of the development is reasonably reflected in the repository 
history. The repository has  4 branches with a reasonable number of commits 
to each branch, demonstrating that the development process made significant 
use of branches. However, all the branches all concerned the front-end. 
There were no branches related to the backend. 

According to the project representative:
> The guy who's in charge of the backend part is currently in China.
> So after we separated the work responsibility at first, we didn't state it
> clear that we should be doing the branches stuff when we pull requests. I 
> found it out when I was about to push the frontend branch, but it was kind of 
> too late.


### Functionality (15/15)

The functionality is very basic but does the job. The website describes the
product feature to record our personal health information. It also mentions 
a community feature to share your experience. These are not available features 
in the current version.


### Organization (14/15)

README.md files in the project sub-directories are either empty or 
are not helpful. It would have been especially useful in understanding
the back-end code. Understanding the directory organization without them
and without any kind of design document is very difficult for someone
who is not familiar with it.



### Methodology (15/15)

* The project shows evidence that an open-source methodology was used during the project
  * The "Weekly Reports" folder documents meeting activities
  * The repository was opened so that customers and stakeholders can access code and process
* The team followed their project communications plan
  * Team communications documented
  * Stakeholder communications
  * Customer communications using piazza, web pages, and release of prototype
* GitHub issues were not used by this project to track issues during development.
* A GitHub project was used by the project to keep track of action items during development. 
  * There are separate project boards for front-end and back-end
  * Dates are not available on issues to enable evaluation the chronology.
* A GitHub wiki was created to record information about the project
  * The wiki has 2 pages including 
    * Home
    * Backend API
      * The backend article documents the backend API in detail
    * Introduction with milestones, features, developers
    * Would be desirable to have more articles on other aspects of the project
      * App architecture 
      * UI and its design
      * Information about technologies used
      * Communications activities carried out
      * Product requirements
      * Plans for testing


### Code (9/10)

The code needs better internal documentation.
